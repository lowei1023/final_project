    "The issue of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is a significant global concern, particularly regarding its impact on climate change and the environment. The United States, as one of the world's top contributors to CO2 emissions, is a focal point for this research. We aim to investigate CO2 emissions in the USA at various levels, including emissions by state, their sources, and their connection to the country's economic performance, measured by the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).This study aims to provide insights into the patterns, factors, and potential implications of carbon emissions in the USA. By comparing this information with the country's economic growth, we hope to reveal the relationship between economic prosperity and environmental impact.\n"

    "In order to address the research questions and find out the relationship between carbon emissions and economic performance, we planned to collect data from the API and csv. We will integrate and combine datasets from these sources to create a comprehensive dataset. This combined dataset will enable us to conduct an examination of the relationship between economic indicators, energy coefficient, and carbon emissions. By bringing together these datasets, we aim to provide a multifaceted perspective on the environmental impact of economic activities.\n",
